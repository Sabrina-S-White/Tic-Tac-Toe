# Tic-Tac-Toe

A Tic Tac Toe game made for The Odin Project lesson on Javascript modules and factory functions. 

DONE - Create a Gameboard module that holds a gameBoard array. 
    DONE - Return the array so the Game module can mark played squares. 
    Create a function that checks the board after each move. 
        If 3 in a row, winner is declared. 
        If no available moves, tie is declared.
    DONE - Create a reset game function that resets all DOM elements. 

Create a Players factory function to generate the two player objects.
    X and O are players. Let user select which they want, two players, or computer takes the other. 
    Let players enter their name(s).

Create a Game module to control the gameplay.
    Game starts, and alternates between players. X starts. 
        As moves are made, you cannot play an occupied square. 
        Computer makes random moves to available squares. 
    DONE - Create a function inside this module that injects the gameBoard array into the HTML. Do this by making the array elements spaces that take up 1 sqaure on a 3x3 grid.
